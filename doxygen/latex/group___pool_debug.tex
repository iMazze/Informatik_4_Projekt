\subsection{Detailed Description}
pools have nested lifetimes -- sub\+\_\+pools are destroyed when the parent pool is cleared. We allow certain liberties with operations on things such as tables (and on other structures in a more general sense) where we allow the caller to insert values into a table which were not allocated from the table\textquotesingle{}s pool. The table\textquotesingle{}s data will remain valid as long as all the pools from which its values are allocated remain valid.

For example, if B is a sub pool of A, and you build a table T in pool B, then it\textquotesingle{}s safe to insert data allocated in A or B into T (because B lives at most as long as A does, and T is destroyed when B is cleared/destroyed). On the other hand, if S is a table in pool A, it is safe to insert data allocated in A into S, but it is {\itshape not safe} to insert data allocated from B into S... because B can be cleared/destroyed before A is (which would leave dangling pointers in T\textquotesingle{}s data structures).

In general we say that it is safe to insert data into a table T if the data is allocated in any ancestor of T\textquotesingle{}s pool. This is the basis on which the A\+P\+R\+\_\+\+P\+O\+O\+L\+\_\+\+D\+E\+B\+UG code works -- it tests these ancestor relationships for all data inserted into tables. A\+P\+R\+\_\+\+P\+O\+O\+L\+\_\+\+D\+E\+B\+UG also provides tools (apr\+\_\+pool\+\_\+find, and apr\+\_\+pool\+\_\+is\+\_\+ancestor) for other folks to implement similar restrictions for their own data structures.

However, sometimes this ancestor requirement is inconvenient -- sometimes it\textquotesingle{}s necessary to create a sub pool where the sub pool is guaranteed to have the same lifetime as the parent pool. This is a guarantee implemented by the {\itshape caller}, not by the pool code. That is, the caller guarantees they won\textquotesingle{}t destroy the sub pool individually prior to destroying the parent pool.

In this case the caller must call apr\+\_\+pool\+\_\+join() to indicate this guarantee to the A\+P\+R\+\_\+\+P\+O\+O\+L\+\_\+\+D\+E\+B\+UG code.

These functions are only implemented when \#\+A\+P\+R\+\_\+\+P\+O\+O\+L\+\_\+\+D\+E\+B\+UG is set.
